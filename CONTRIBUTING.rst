project page.

Contribute to code
++++++++++++++++++

Changes to the source code and documentation should be made via GitHub
pull requests (PR).

You can learn how to do this from this *free* video series `How to
Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub
<https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github>`__,
Aaron Meurer's `tutorial on the git workflow
<https://www.asmeurer.com/git-workflow/>`__, or the guide `How to
Contribute to Open Source
<https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/>`__.

The important steps to follow are:

1. Start by creating a fork of the ``forestatrisk`` repository
2. Make changes to the source code on a development branch, not the default *master* branch
3. Keep your fork's master and development branches up to date with changes in the ``forestatrisk`` repository
4. Commit the changes you made. Chris Beams has written a `guide <https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/>`__
   on how to write good commit messages.
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
